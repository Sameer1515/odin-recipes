    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>pour the chicken broth into a saucepan with the onion and garlic;bring to a boil and
           cook at a boil until the liquid reduces by half,about 10 minutes.Pour in the white
           wine,return to boil, =and reduce the liquid by half again,about 10 minutes.Stir in
           mushrooms,rosemary,and sage;simmer until the mushrooms are tender and have given up
           their juice,about 15 more minutes.Stir in cream,butter,lemone,and capers;reduce heat
           and simmer the sauce until thickened,about 10 minutes(45 minutes in all).
        </p>
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <p>Place the cornstarch into a shallow bowl and press the chicken thighs into the
            cornstarch on all sides until thoroughly coated. Shake off excess cornstarch.
            Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; pan-fry the chicken thighs 
            until they develop a golden brown crust, about 8 minutes per side. Place the 
            chicken thighs into a 9x9-inch baking dish and pour the sauce over the chicken.
        </p>
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until the sauce is bubbling and the chicken is no 
           longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
           into the center of a chicken thigh should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
